## Description

In this project we will create a an application that will help students find the perfect tutor for there needs by displaying all available tutors and their reviews.

This website relys on our users to leave tutor reviews. These tutor reviews will be listed for other users to use as a reference.

We will be using express to handle our routes and sequalize to proform CRUD operations on our database.

We also use Mysql12 as our database. This database has 3 tables. Student, Tutor, and Review.

In this project we learned how to tie in all aspects of web development to make our first full stack project.

## Usage

To use this application write "node index.js" this will start the web application on the local host.

After starting up the application, users are able to navigate around our whole website without logging in. If you want to leave a review for a specific tutor you will need to log in for that.

Users are able to log in as a student or as a tutor.

After logging in as a student you are then able to leave reviews for individual tutors.

Users can also navigate to our tutors page which will display all tutors. Users could then click on a tutor name which will navigate the user to the corrisponding tutors profile page which will display tutor information and all reviews that have been left for that tutor. This can help you dicide whether or not that tutor is right for you by noting all of the reviews left by other students.
